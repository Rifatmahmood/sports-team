He made his first team debut at the age of 17 on 2 February 2019, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 2–0 Campeonato Sul-Mato-Grossense away win against Operário de Dourados.\r\n\r\nRonald scored his first senior goal on 16 February 2019, netting his team's third in a 3–1 home win against Aquidauanense. He also spent a period on a trial at Atlético Mineiro before signing for the under-20 side of Atlético Goianiense.\r\n\r\nRonald started to appear in the first team of Dragão in January 2021, but was loaned to Grêmio Anápolis on 24 February 2021, until the end of the Campeonato Goiano. After helping the latter side win the competition for the first time ever with two goals (one of them against his parent club) in 14 appearances, he signed a permanent deal with Grêmio Anápolis and subsequently returned to Atlético for the Série A, on loan.\r\n\r\nRonald made his debut in the main category of Brazilian football on 30 May 2021, starting in 1–0 away win against Corinthians.\r\n\r\nOn 20 January 2022, Grêmio Anápolis sent Ronald on loan to Série B side Guarani.\r\n\r\nOn 13 July 2022, Ronald's loan spell at Guarani was cut short and he was instead sent on a season-long loan to Liga Portugal 2 club Estrela da Amadora. At the end of the campaign, following Estrela's promotion to the Primeira Liga, Ronald's loan was extended for another season.\r\n\r\nIn January 2024, Ronald signed a three-and-a-half-year contract, with an option for a further year, with EFL Championship side Swansea City, for a fee reported to be between €1.5 million and €2 million. He was praised by head coach Luke Williams after playing for the team, whilst Ronald said that he wanted to be successful for his family in Brazil.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima (Brazilian Portuguese: ; born 18 September 1976), commonly known as Ronaldo or Ronaldo Nazário, is a Brazilian business owner, president of La Liga club Real Valladolid, owner of Brasileiro Série B club Cruzeiro and a retired professional footballer who played as a striker. Popularly dubbed O Fenômeno ('The Phenomenon') and also nicknamed R9, he is widely considered as one of the greatest players of all time. As a multi-functional striker who brought a new dimension to the position, Ronaldo has been the influence for a generation of strikers that have followed. His individual accolades include being named FIFA World Player of the Year three times and winning two Ballon d'Or awards.\r\n\r\nRonaldo started his career at Cruzeiro and moved to PSV in 1994. He joined Barcelona in 1996 for a then world record transfer fee and at 20 years old, he was named the 1996 FIFA World Player of the Year, making him the youngest recipient of the award. In 1997, Inter Milan broke the world record fee to sign Ronaldo, making him the first player since Diego Maradona to break the world transfer record twice. At 21, he received the 1997 Ballon d'Or and remains the youngest recipient of the award. By the age of 23, Ronaldo had scored over 200 goals for club and country. However, after a series of knee injuries and recuperation, he was inactive for almost three years. Ronaldo joined Real Madrid in 2002 and won the 2002–03 La Liga title. He had spells at AC Milan and Corinthians before retiring in 2011, having suffered further injuries.\r\n\r\nRonaldo played for Brazil in 98 matches, scoring 62 goals and is the third-highest goalscorer for his national team. At age 17, he was the youngest member of the Brazilian squad that won the 1994 FIFA World Cup. At the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Ronaldo received the Golden Ball as the player of the tournament after he helped Brazil reach the final, where he suffered a convulsive fit hours before kick-off. He won the 2002 FIFA World Cup, starring in a front three with Ronaldinho and Rivaldo. He scored twice in the final and received the Golden Boot as the tournament's top goalscorer. At the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Ronaldo scored his 15th World Cup goal, a tournament record at the time. He also won the 1997 Copa América, where he became the player of the tournament and the 1999 Copa América, where he was the top goalscorer.\r\n\r\nOne of the most marketable sportsmen in the world during his playing career, the first Nike Mercurial boots called R9 were commissioned for Ronaldo in 1998. He was named in the FIFA 100 list of the greatest living players compiled in 2004 by Pelé also and was inducted into the Brazilian Football Museum Hall of Fame, Italian Football Hall of Fame, Inter Milan Hall of Fame and Real Madrid Hall of Fame. In 2020, Ronaldo was named in the Ballon d'Or Dream Team, a greatest all-time XI published by France Football magazine. In retirement from sport, Ronaldo has continued his work as a United Nations Development Programme Goodwill Ambassador, a position to which he was appointed in 2000. He served as an ambassador for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Ronaldo became the majority owner of Real Valladolid in September 2018, after buying 51% of the club's shares. In December 2021, he bought a controlling stake in his boyhood club Cruzeiro, investing $70 million in the club.\r\n\r\nRonaldo made his international debut for Brazil on 23 March 1994 in a friendly match in Recife against Argentina. His first senior goal for Brazil came on 4 May 1994 in a 3–0 friendly win against Iceland. He went to the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States aged 17, but did not play as Brazil went on to win the tournament. He stated he was \"overjoyed\" at the experience. He was then known as Ronaldinho (\"little Ronaldo\" in Portuguese), because Ronaldo Rodrigues de Jesus, his older teammate, was also called Ronaldo and later nicknamed Ronaldão (\"big Ronaldo\") to further distinguish them. Another Brazilian player, Ronaldo de Assis Moreira, now widely known as Ronaldinho, was called Ronaldinho Gaúcho when he joined the Brazilian senior team in 1999.",

He has won twice on the tour; the 2018 Honma Hong Kong Open and the 2020 Aberdeen Standard Investments Scottish Open. He is one of the few professional golfers to wear two gloves.\r\nRai turned professional in 2012. In 2014 and 2015 he played on the PGA EuroPro Tour. He won the 2015 Glenfarclas Open after a playoff, finished 5th in the Order of Merit and was promoted to the Challenge Tour for 2016.\r\nRai was 18th in the 2016 Challenge Tour Order of Merit and just missed out on a European Tour place. His best finish was joint runner-up in the Le Vaudreuil Golf Challenge, a stroke behind the winner, Alexander Björk. \r\nIn September 2020, Rai held the 54-hole lead at the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open, but was unable to convert this into a victory as John Catlin overtook him by two shots; ultimately finishing runner-up. A week later, Rai defeated Tommy Fleetwood in a playoff to win the Aberdeen Standard Investments Scottish Open, a result that lifted him into the world top 100 for the first time.",
